# Mauricio Tec

I am a Research Associate at Harvard University interested in AI for decision-making. My main expertise is in reinforcement learning (RL) which I complement with deep learning, statistical modeling, and causality. I currently work on applications to improve adaptation and mitigation strategies for climate change's health impacts. I was a member of the [UT Austin Villa](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~AustinVilla/) Robot Soccer Team. I'm increasingly fascinated by LLMs/foundation models and their potential to enhance/ground RL and other sequential decision-making algorithms.
