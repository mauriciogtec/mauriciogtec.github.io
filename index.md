# About me

Hello! I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University, specializing in representation learning methods for decision-making. My research focuses on developing representations that support counterfactual reasoning, generalize across datasets and tasks, and integrate external commonsense knowledge. This involves integrating advancements from reinforcement learning, foundation models, and statistical techniques. My work also includes representation learning for structured domains such as images, graphs, spatiotemporal data, and higher-order topological data. Additionally, I have collaborated on various AI applications for social impact, particularly in public health and climate change mitigation.


I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Texas at Austin, focusing on reinforcement learning, computer vision, and statistical applications. Prior to my Ph.D., I completed a B.S. in Applied Mathematics at ITAM and an M.S. in Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. I have held internships at Meta AI (FAIR) and Intel AI. I was also a member of the UT Austin Villa Robot Soccer Team, where I developed a deep-learning vision system for autonomous soccer robots.

### Research

My research interests focus on the following key areas:

1. **Representations for counterfactual reasoning and planning**: Developing representations that provide reliable guarantees for counterfactual reasoning, particularly in offline settings. This research intersects with causal inference, offline reinforcement learning, and world models.


2. **Self-supervised learning**: Developing learning methods from unlabeled or partially labeled data across multiple modalities and tasks. The goal is to create foundation models that can be easily fine-tuned for counterfactual inference and sequential decision-making tasks, robust to distributional shifts, and adaptable to new features or datasets. 

3. **Common-sense and external knowledge**: Fascinated by AI systems that can leverage external common-sense reasoning to overcome *tabula rasa* learning. With the advent of LLMs and foundation models, combining LLMs and other foundation models with learning embeddings of features to improve the generalization of models to new tasks and domains.

904. **Representations in structured graph-like domains**: Learning representations in structured domains such as graph-based and temporal data. In addition to graph neural networks, I have adopted the topological deep learning paradigm, which allows for capturing higher-order interactions in the data.

My work has been published in top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, and AAAI, and in scientific journals such as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, this research has significant implications for public health, particularly in designing AI-driven interventions and policies for climate change adaptation and mitigation.
