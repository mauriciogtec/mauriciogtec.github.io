# Hello! 

I am a Research Scientist at Harvard University, co-supervised by Milind Tambe and Francesca Dominici. My research focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), large language models (LLMs), and diffusion generative models with real-world applications. Recent projects include using RL to enhance LLM agent performance and interpretability, developing new transfer learning techniques for diffusion language models, improving the robustness of online RLHF with LLM judges, and training foundation models for counterfactual inference. Much of my current work has some application in AI for social good, particularly in public health. However, I aim to develop methods that are also widely applicable in industrial applications.


## About Me

I am an applied scientist with a strong interdisciplinary background spanning computer science, statistics, and mathematics and a passion for scalable and good-quality code. My work has been published in top-tier computer science conferences and scientific journals. I hold a Ph.D. from UT Austin, where I conducted research in RL, machine learning, and robotics, developed critical statistical models that UT Austin used for Covid-19 policy recommendations to the city of Austin, and collaborated in numerous cross-disciplinary projects.

Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a data scientist in industry, where I developed expertise and passion for building and deploying AI systems for real-world applications.

***I am excited to pursue new opportunities in agentic AI, RL, autonomous systems, LLMs, GenAI, and robotics. Please feel free to reach out with potential collaborations and career prospects in these domains.***

## Research

My current projects focus on three directions: first, leveraging LLMs for reinforcement learning, particularly for improving explainability, generalization, and as engines for generative agent-based simulations; second, leveraging diffusion generative models as powerful engines for causal reasoning and planning; and third, developing new representation learning methods for decision-making tasks. Check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AF_rzg8AAAAJ&hl=en) for more details about my previous work. -->


<!-- ## Bio

I hold a BSc and Masters in Mathematics from ITAM and The University of Cambridge. I completed my PhD in Machine Learning and Statistics at UT Austin focusing on reinforcement learning and computer vision applications, where I was also a member of the [Learning Agents Research Group](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/research.shtml]) at the Computer Science Department. During this time, I participated in the UT Austin Villa Robot Soccer Team, where I developed a deep-learning vision system for autonomous soccer robots and competed at the [Robocup](https://www.robocup.org/events/upcoming_events). Additionally, I held internships at Meta AI (FAIR) and Intel AI, and was as a core member of UT Austin's Covid-19 response team during the pandemic. -->

### Research

My research interests focus on the following key areas:

1. **Representations for counterfactual reasoning and planning**: Developing representations that provide reliable guarantees for counterfactual reasoning, particularly in offline settings. This research intersects with causal inference, offline reinforcement learning, and world models.


2. **Self-supervised learning**: Developing learning methods from unlabeled or partially labeled data across multiple modalities and tasks. The goal is to create foundation models that can be easily fine-tuned for counterfactual inference and sequential decision-making tasks, robust to distributional shifts, and adaptable to new features or datasets. 

3. **Common-sense and external knowledge**: Fascinated by AI systems that can leverage external common-sense reasoning to overcome *tabula rasa* learning. With the advent of LLMs and foundation models, combining LLMs and other foundation models with learning embeddings of features to improve the generalization of models to new tasks and domains.

904. **Representations in structured graph-like domains**: Learning representations in structured domains such as graph-based and temporal data. In addition to graph neural networks, I have adopted the topological deep learning paradigm, which allows for capturing higher-order interactions in the data.

My work has been published in top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, and AAAI, and in scientific journals such as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, this research has significant implications for public health, particularly in designing AI-driven interventions and policies for climate change adaptation and mitigation.
